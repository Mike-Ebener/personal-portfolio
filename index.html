                Mike is a few years into his career journey in Product Management and has found the role of his dreams.  He’s had incredible opportunities to learn key product strategy and operations components of the role but hasn’t had deep exposure to software development.  He’s excited to learn the details of software development so I can better support  engineering partners, and position himself for further growth in Product.
                When not writing code and developing Products, Mike enjoys spending time in the San Francisco Bay on his boat.  He loves spending time with his Cocker Spaniel Shea and wife Holly.
